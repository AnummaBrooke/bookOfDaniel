Eberhart: Online Learning Tools

<p>As you begin reviewing the course hubs on this GETSCOS site for your individual classes, you will note that faculty have configured&nbsp;their 5 pre-session hours somewhat differently to meet the teaching goals of their respective courses. Still, you can expect that across the entire 20 course curriculum, you will encounter at least four of the basic online tools found in the Google Suite: Google Docs, Google Groups, Google Hangouts, and Youtube. As such, you will need to familiarize yourself with the use of these tools in order to participate successfully in the online learning component of the COS curriculum at Garrett-Evangelical. The following tutorial links provide a helpful start:&nbsp;</p>

Civetta: 2" Picture Frame Sermon

<p>Please come to our first class of the sermon with what I call a 2" sermon.&nbsp; It is a sermon of no more than 5 minutes (really, I want you to time yourself and know it won't go over).&nbsp; It should have a beginning, middle, and end, and not serve as the opening of a fuller sermon you have given or want to give.&nbsp; You may choose your topic/scripture, but I do not recommend trying to shorten an already completed sermon.&nbsp; In that case, you will be giving us a Cliff Notes version of a sermon, whereas I want a fully fleshed out, albeit short, sermon.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please remember the purpose of this course is to learn and grow.&nbsp; Therefore, you do not need to try and give us your best work ever.&nbsp; Instead, use this experience as an opportunity for growth.&nbsp; Create a sermon that is true for you, but also pushes you in some way.&nbsp; Raise the bar of your own expectations, and you will be amazed at what you accomplish.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have any questions about this assignment, feel free to contact me.</p>

<h1>Read</h1>
<h3><em>Modern Christian Theology</em>, Chapter 1: "The Legacy of Modernity and the New Challenge of Historical Theology," pp. 1-32</h3>
<h3><em>Faith Seeking Understanding</em>, Chapters 1-3: "The Task of Theology," The Meaning of Revelation," and "The Authority of Scripture," pp. 1-65</h3>
<p></p>
<h1>Respond</h1>
<p>On page 2 of <em>Modern Christian Thought</em>, the authors state that "the question of authority is not a modern problem in Christianity." Nevertheless, modern Christianity has set forth some unique responses to the question of authority. Drawing from both assigned readings, write an overview of the key ways in which contemporary theology approaches the question of authority (500 words / two pages maximum)</p>

<p>Phyllis Tickle, speaking on the transitions of religious ages and "The Great Emergence"<br>[audio mp3="http://www.getscos.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TNS-1401b_Tickle_PRX_64K_CBR_52m04s.mp3"][/audio]</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Respond</h1>
<p>In the interview, Phyllis Tickle makes the claim that seminarians in the 21st century should be required to study cosmology and quantum physics. Using her interview and the readings assigned above as a starting point, put forth your own argument for what contemporary seminarians should be required to study, and why. You can suggest anything, so long as your reasoning can be demonstrated as to how the subject(s) will equip students for ministry in the 21st century (500 words / two pages maximum)</p>

Dault: Assignment 10 - Reading and Response

<h1>Reading</h1>
<h3><em>Modern Christian Thought</em>, Chapter 11: "History and Hermenuetics," pp.&nbsp;341 - 386</h3>
<h3><em>Faith Seeking Understanding,</em> Chapter&nbsp;5: "The Good Creation," pp.&nbsp;96 - 120, and Appendices C and D: "Political Theology: A Dialogue," and "Atheism: A Dialogue," pp. 400 -</h3>
<h1>Response</h1>
<p>MIgliore notes that "science and faith not only need not be at war with each other but each can and should influence and enrich each other" (page 118). In a sense, this brings us full circle, back to the insights of Phyllis Tickle in Unit 1. But if science allows us an adequate and full explanation of the world (and indeed, can help us productively address the world "in crisis"), then why - as the atheist might ask - do we need religion at all? In a world of both suffering and science, what is the possible justification for remaining a person of faith? (500 words / 2 pages maximum - although this actually will take you a lifetime to wrestle and figure out)</p>

<p></p>
<h1>Response</h1>
<p>On page 153 of <em>Faith Seeking Understanding</em>, Migliore states that " to say that God is triune is to say also that human life is fulfilled only in relationship with God and others."

<p></p>
<h1>Responding</h1>
<p>MIgliore begins Chapter 4 with the claim that "talk of God has become a problem for many people today," in part because "belief in God and affirmation of human freedom [seem] incompatible." How does Reinhold Neibuhr address this problem - particularly with regard to the tension between<em> love</em> and <em>justice</em> in his theology? (500 words / two pages maximum)</p>

<p></p>
<h1>Responding</h1>
<p>John Thataminil describes a contemporary church setting where you might find "a worship service on the first floor and a yoga class in the basement."

<p></p>
<h1>Responding</h1>
