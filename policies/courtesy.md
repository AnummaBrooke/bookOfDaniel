We agree to be fully present to our classmates during our sessions. Phones and laptops will only be used in ways directly related to activities underway during our class time. Students may not accept phone calls or TMs during class, nor engage in side conversations and side texting. Web-surfing not related to the activity underway is profoundly discourteous and will not be permitted. During quizzes and exams, all electronic devices must be turned off.

Again: it is *not okay* to "take a break" during class and engage in unrelated web activity. This calls for special discipline and discernment in an environment where laptops and other devices are being used for course activities (Tweeting, editing Google Docs, doing web searches, and so on).

If the instructor is persuaded that extra-curricular web activity has become a distraction, a no-laptop policy will be introduced, and it's likely that everyone will know that it is because of you.
