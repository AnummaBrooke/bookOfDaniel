### Late Work:

Late work will not be accepted for review. Late means "late": please do not assume a "period of grace" beyond stated deadlines. For example, "midnight" means "midnight."

*Plan your work so that an acute crisis—brief illness, computer or internet trouble, locusts—does not interfere with timely accomplishment of course work.* In the event of "late-breaking" acute troubles, the student should already have substantive, if incomplete, work prepared to turn in on deadline. Such work can be submitted by alternative means (by hand, by email) if conditions present the student no alternative.

*Emergency:* occasionally, a student may suddenly require accommodation from the institution because of a genuine and time-consuming emergency. Such a matter should be brought to the attention of the Dean of Students and the office of the Academic Dean without delay. At the institution's discretion, a plan for completion of missed work might be arranged. This protects the student from unintended difficulties that can arise if she tries to make separate arrangements with individual professors.

*Special Needs or Disability:* a student who believes her circumstances require extended deadlines for written work, or longer completion times for exams, may bring this to the attention of the Dean of Students and the office of the Academic Dean. At the Dean’s discretion, such arrangements might be made. Such arrangements will not be retroactive: they take effect when made. *See course policy, immediately below, concerning special needs or disability.*
