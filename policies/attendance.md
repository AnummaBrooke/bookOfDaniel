### Attendance: 

Attendance philosophy: Learning is a collaborative endeavor, and students are obliged to offer one another their informed, prepared presence. We do not show up simply for ourselves, but for one another. "A rising tide lifts all boats," "No one can lift herself up by her own bootstraps," and so on.

Opportunities missed on account of tardiness may not be made up. Excessive tardiness, or leaving early, can count as absence, at the instructor's discretion.

For every absence, the student will write a 500 word summary of the readings assigned for that class, due one week from the date of absence. *Every* absence will have a negative effect on oneâ€™s grade. Per the Student Handbook, students who miss 20% of sessions (three sessions, or two sessions plus significant tardiness) will not pass the course.
