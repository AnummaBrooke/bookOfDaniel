# The Book of Daniel (11-603, 2012)

## Description
"Students will engage the book of Daniel theologically, in conversation with two distinct but related approaches to texts: narrative criticism and form criticism."

## Book List
There are three books, each required:

1. Rimmon-Kenan, Shlomith. *Narrative Fiction.* 2nd edition. London: Routledge, 2002. ISBN-13 9780415280228 (pbk.). Cost appx. $31 (Cokesbury; only hardback currently available on Amazon for $110, or Kindle edition for only $10).
2. Collins, John J. *Daniel: With an Introduction to Apocalyptic Literature.* Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans, 1984. ISBN-10 0-8028-0020-3 (pbk.). Cost appx. $18 (Amazon or Cokesbury).
3. NRSV study Bible, either Harper-Collins or Oxford. Cost appx. $36-$45.

## Assignments
Assignments include weekly informed participation; two presentations; and a final, integrative, exegetical project.

1. *Informed participation:* Half or more of each session will normally be of a seminar style, with discussions and activities, and even lectures will have an interactive component.
3. *Narrative Criticism Presentation:* Each student will offer one presentation on a selection from Rimmon-Kenan. Presenters should plan on 45 minutes of session time, of which no more than 20 minutes is a presentation delivered from a standing position with an A/V component, with the remaining time spent facilitating a planned discussion. See rubric.
2. *Form Criticism Presentation:* Each student will also offer one presentation on a selection from Collins. See above for expectations.
4. *Integrative, exegetical project:* this may be a final paper, or in the form of "digital storytelling." Either way, the assignment will include a satisfactorily exegetical component, focused on some aspect of the meaning of a text for Daniel's author(s) and its original audience(s). It will also include a component that integrates the student's other theological course work into a compelling story of personal significance.
