## Learning Goals and Outcomes:

Two ends are in view: one, that the student gain a deep and textured familiarity with this difficult and influential book and with the critical issues that have driven its study; two, that the student develop her ability to situate, amidst the continuing flowering of critical approaches, the pressing theological questions which she herself brings to Scripture.
