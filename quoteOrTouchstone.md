**Lester's Rule of Engagement:**

> When making any contribution to the course—in papers, discussion board posts, comments, or any other venue—ask yourself this question:

> "Could I have made this contribution before ever having taken this class?"*

> If the answer is "Yes," then the work is not yet appropriate to our shared endeavors. Every contribution should be of such a kind that one must have read our readings, heard our lectures, and participated in our discussions, in order to be able to make that contribution.
