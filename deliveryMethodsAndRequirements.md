##Delivery Method and Requirements:

We will meet weekly in person. We will use the Moodle learning management system, and also, we will adopt Twitter for a part of our course work. So, students will need regular internet access between sessions. 

*Technical Requirements:*

1. Students must have regular, reliable access to a broad-band (high-speed) internet connection (e.g., DSL or cable; note that modem dial-up will not prove sufficient). 

1. Students should plan to open a Twitter account. Students may choose to open a pseudonymous account, though the pseudonym should be easy enough for classmates to recognize. Students with existing accounts may use these, or open a new, pseudonymous account.

1. Students must have access to a reasonably up-to-date computer and operating system, sufficient to run an up-to-date web browser. Computers must play sound. For the "digital storytelling" project, a webcam may prove desirable. The G-ETS library has a limited number of laptop computers available for check-out. The Northwestern University Library has a computer center as well.

1. Students must plan to use a recent version of a major Web browser (e.g., Firefox 3 or later; Safari 3; Google Chrome 4 or later; Opera 9 or later; MS Internet Explorer 7 or later). Note especially that MS Internet Explorer 6, still common on older machines, is NOT supported.

1. Students must be able to work with files normal to the Microsoft Office environment, especially *.doc/*.docx, *.ppt/*.pptx. Many students with Apple computers can manage such files with the iWork suite of applications. Students without MS Office or Apple iWork might try the freely available OpenOffice application: http://www.openoffice.org/

1. Some students may find it useful to have a headset with a microphone. These typically work with either Windows or Mac, have a USB connection to the computer, and are available at places like Radio Shack or Best Buy (phone first).

1. Students may be asked to download and use safe, freely-available, cross-platform software like Apple QuickTime or iTunes.
